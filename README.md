# This is the source for the website for our app

This is uses these technologys for quick developement, React Native for Web, Expo, and Webpack. React Native for web allows us to share code from the app to the website. Expo allows for easy development I will elaborate further in this readme. Finaly Webpack converts the javascript and typescript to a single package for deployment.

## Quick Start

- install dependency's `npm install`

Web:

- Start the expo dev server `npm start`
- A webpage should open and from there you have the option to launch the website.
- Once you select this the real website will open.
- Any changes you make in the code will be expressed once you save the files.
